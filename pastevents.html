            We plan to fundraise for our club while also spreading news of ClimateScience and climate change. We are given a 10ft by 10ft space where we will be having two activities: an art activity and a spin-the-wheel for donors. The art activity will involve strips of recycled paper where participants will either draw or write something related to the environment; the volunteers would then form a chain with them and hang it up as a banner. That activity will be free of charge while the  spin-the-wheel activity will be how we fundraise. Donors will donate a minimum of $1 to spin the wheel where they will get: bronze tier, silver tier, gold tier, mystery bag, and try again. Bronze tier, silver tier, and gold tier are the groups of various prizes. The mystery bag will contain (2-3) prizes from the other tiers while “try again” will allow participants to answer a question, sign up for the olympiad, or download the ClimateScience app for a bronze prize and spin again. In addition to the two activities, we will also lay out brochures about ClimateScience and also have sign up sheets for our club and clean up the lake group volunteering available.
